# Predicting-Students-Proficiency-of-Online-Learning-Courses
Junyi Academy Foundation, a non-profit organization based in Taiwan that aims to provide all children equitable quality education by technology, is eager to support our learning community during this pandemic. They released a dataset consisting of over 16 million exercise attempt logs on our platform from more than 72,000 students over the course of a year (from 2018/08 to 2019/07). I used their dataset to predict the level a student will acheive in each online course exercise using a Random Forest Model.This could empower the research of creating a better and personalized learning experience for students, and further encourage broader participation for contributing to the future of online learning from interdisciplinary experts.
